? Select a default Firebase project for this directory: developer-portfolio-97fcc (Developer Portfolio)
i  Using project developer-portfolio-97fcc (Developer Portfolio)

=== Hosting Setup

Your public directory is the folder (relative to your project directory) that
will contain Hosting assets to be uploaded with firebase deploy. If you
have a build process for your assets, use your build's output directory.

? What do you want to use as your public directory? C:\Users\Donika\reactsimpleproject\public
? Configure as a single-page app (rewrite all urls to /index.html)? No
